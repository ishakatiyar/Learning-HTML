    <p>
      Krishna (Sanskrit: कृष्ण) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped
      as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme god in his own
      right. He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love; and
      is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities. The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[18] They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being.[19] His iconography reflects these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees; or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.

      Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or
      blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets, and
      titles that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most
      common names are<i> <b>Mohan</b></i> "enchanter";
      <i><b>Govinda</b></i> "chief herdsman".
      Krishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and playing the bansuri (Indian flute).[93][94] In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic young boy with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.

      Krishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with
      some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black,
      dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and
      stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of
      which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia.In some texts, his
      skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a
      purple-colored fruit).

      The legends of Krishna's childhood and youth describe him as a cow-herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earn him the nickname Makhan Chor (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.

      <strong> name and synonyms of Krishna </strong>have been traced to 1st millennium BCE literature and cults.[21] In some sub-traditions, Krishna is worshipped as Svayam Bhagavan (the Supreme God), and it is sometimes known as Krishnaism. These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement.[22][23] Krishna-related literature has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance. He is a pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations, such as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat; the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal; in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at Nathdwara in Rajasthan,Udupi Krishna in Karnataka,Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu and in Aranmula, Kerala, and Guruvayoorappan in Guruvayoor in Kerala. Since the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world and to Africa, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

      Childhood and youth
    </h3>
    <pre>
      Other legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, 
      &lt;b&gt; especially Radha.&lt;/b&gt;
       These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the Rasa lila and were romanticized 
      in the poetry of Jayadeva, author of the Gita Govinda. They are also central to the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna.
    </pre>
    <code>
      Krishna's childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of Lila, 
    </code>
   playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the Yamuna River and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.<br>
