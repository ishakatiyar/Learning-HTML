      as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme god in his own
      right. He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love; and

      Krishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with
      some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black,
      dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and
      stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of
      which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia.In some texts, his
      skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a
      purple-colored fruit).
    </p>
    <p>
      Krishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and
      playing the bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown
      standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the Tribhanga posture.
      He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine
      herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic young boy with
      the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.

      The legends of Krishna's childhood and youth describe him as a cow-herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earn him the nickname Makhan Chor (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.
